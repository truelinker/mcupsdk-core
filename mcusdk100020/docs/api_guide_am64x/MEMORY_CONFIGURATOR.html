Introduction</h1>
<p>In the prior versions of the SDK, linker files presented challenges in terms of ease of maintenance. Linker files were generated from templates, meaning that any alterations to parameters such as stack size, heap size, memory regions, or sections necessitated direct edits to the linker files. This process proved to be cumbersome and difficult to manage.</p>
<p>The Memory Configurator tool seamlessly integrated into sysconfig empowers users to configure critical parameters. By utilizing this tool, corresponding linker files are automatically generated. This feature significantly streamlines the process, eliminating the need for manual adjustments to the linker files and providing users with a hassle-free experience.</p>
<p>Please refer to the section "By-passing Sysconfig generated Linker" to use hand written linker file.</p>

<div class="caption">
Demonstrating a multi core scenario</div></div>
<p>Suppose core 0 has a memory region named MEM0 with a start address of 0x0 and a length of 16KB. Core 1, on the other hand, possesses a memory region named MEM1 with a start address of 0x4000 and a length of 64 KB. Now, in the event that the user wishes to expand the size of MEM0, this action would necessitate an adjustment in the start address of MEM1 while ensuring its size remains unchanged. Furthermore, if there are any other memory regions defined immediately after MEM1, all corresponding adjustments would need to be made. The integration of this tool facilitates these modifications, sparing the user the need to manually edit each individual configuration.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md2504"></a>
Handling Violations and Common Configuration Errors</h1>
<p>There are scenarios where a core attempts to configure the Memory Protection Unit (MPU) for a memory region that hasn't been assigned to it. This constitutes a violation that requires proper handling.</p>
<p>Another common error involves designating a shared memory region as cached. This tool serves as a safeguard against such mistakes, ensuring that these violations and configuration errors are prevented.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md2505"></a>
Getting Started with the Tool</h1>
<p>Within the tool interface, the user will find a section labeled "MEMORY" on the left pane. This section encompasses three key components: "General," "Memory Region," and "Sections."</p>
<p>In the forthcoming discussion, each of these components will be explored in detail. This will equip users with the knowledge and guidance required to configure the tool in alignment with their specific requirements.</p>
<dl class="section note"><dt>Note</dt><dd>The tool doesn't support GCC compilers.</dd></dl>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md2506"></a>
General</h2>
<p>Within this section, the user will have the option to configure essential parameters such as stack size, heap size, IRQ (Interrupt Request), FIQ (Fast Interrupt Request), SVC (Supervisor Call), Abort Stack and Undefined Stack sizes.</p>
<p>Upon adding an instance, these parameters will be automatically populated with their default values.</p>
<p>Additionally, the user will have the capability to select the compiler, which will determine the syntax for generating the linker files.</p>

Memory Region</h2>
<p> <style>div.image img[src="memory_region_start.png"]{width:50%}</style> </p><div class="image">
<img src="memory_region_start.png" alt=""/>
<div class="caption">
Initial Sysconfig view of Memory Region</div></div>
<p>The Memory Region configuration is a pivotal aspect with several integrated features.</p>
<p>Upon clicking the "Add" button, an option titled "Automate MPU Setting" will become available. By default, this option will remain unchecked. In this scenario, users can add memory regions without any associated MPU settings, unless configured otherwise. There is no restriction on the size in the sense that it doesn't need to be power of 2 and can take any value within its memory type limit.</p>
<p>If the user opts to check this option, it signifies that each memory region instance may be linked to a maximum of one MPU configuration. This implies that when a user adds a memory region instance and desires to include an MPU setting, they are exempted from the manual entry of parameters such as address and size.</p>
<p>The tool employs a specific algorithm for memory region allocation:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>It initially identifies all memory region instances of a particular type for eg whether it's FLASH/ RAM etc.<ul>
<li>to know more on this, please refer section "Enhanced Visualization View" at the bottom.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Instances with manually assigned start addresses take precedence and are positioned at the forefront within the memory region of that type.</li>
<li>Subsequently, any remaining unassigned regions result in empty spaces, known as "holes." These holes are then sorted from smallest to largest.</li>
<li>For memory regions with automatically calculated start addresses, the tool allocates them to the smallest hole that has sufficient space to accommodate them.</li>
<li>In the event that the tool encounters size constraints preventing the allocation of a memory region, it will promptly flag an error.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here is an illustration to explain the above:</p>
<p> <style>div.image img[src="memory_region_eg_ocram1.png"]{width:50%}</style> </p><div class="image">
<img src="memory_region_eg_ocram1.png" alt=""/>

<div class="caption">

<img src="memory_region_eg_ocram4.png" alt=""/>
<div class="caption">
Memory Region Configuration for OCRAM4</div></div>
<p>In this configuration, there are four designated regions: OCRAM_1 and OCRAM_2 have auto-generated start addresses, while OCRAM_3 and OCRAM_4 possess manually assigned ones. Following the algorithm's guidelines, the regions with manual start addresses, OCRAM_3 and OCRAM_4, take precedence. They are first accommodated within the OCRAM space. Subsequently, three gaps remain: one to the left of OCRAM_3, another between OCRAM_3 and OCRAM_4, and a third to the right of OCRAM_4. The algorithm then selects the smallest available gap to house the largest auto start address region, OCRAM_2.</p>
<p>Afterwards, OCRAM_1 is placed in the gap adjacent to OCRAM_2, as it is the smallest one capable of accommodating OCRAM_1.</p>
<p> <style>div.image img[src="memory_region_eg_layout.png"]{width:90%}</style> </p><div class="image">
<img src="memory_region_eg_layout.png" alt=""/>
<div class="caption">
Memory Region Configuration Layout</div></div>
<dl class="section note"><dt>Note</dt><dd>Once a memory region is assigned to a core, it is prohibited from being overlapped by any other region, whether by the same core or a different one. For memory types which are core-specific i.e. belong exclusively to a core, it is permissible to use the same start address and size. This is because, at the physical level, it does not constitute actual overlap.</dd></dl>
<p>The other fields which we have for configuring a memory region are:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Attributes: It's a multi-select drop down option button with options as Read, Write, Execute and Initialize. By default all of them are selected.<ul>
<li>R specifies that the memory can be read.</li>
<li>W specifies that the memory can be written to.</li>
<li>X specifies that the memory can contain executable code.</li>
<li>I specifies that the memory can be initialized.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Last Symbol: LAST optionally specifies a symbol that can be used at run-time to find the address of the last allocated byte in the memory range.</li>
<li>Shared: On checking this box, we get an option to choose what all cores the user wants to share the current memory region with. As already mentioned that once a region is assigned to a core, it can't be overlapped by other.<ul>
<li>Another feature which might be required sometimes is the renaming of a shared core. This is can done from the "Rename Shared Region" module. In the below example we can see R5FSS0-0 is sharing all these regions with R5FSS0-1.  <style>div.image img[src="rename_shared_region_1.png"]{width:90%}</style> <div class="image">
<img src="rename_shared_region_1.png" alt=""/>
<div class="caption">
Rename Shared Region: Options to rename</div></div>
</li>
<li>Now, if R5FSS0-1 wants to rename any of them, then select and rename. Here LOG_SHM_MEM is changed to LOG_SHM_MEM_X.  <style>div.image img[src="rename_shared_region_2.png"]{width:90%}</style> <div class="image">
<img src="rename_shared_region_2.png" alt=""/>
<div class="caption">
Rename Shared Region: After renaming</div></div>
</li>
<li>In the linker.cmd of R5FSS0_1 we can see all those shared regions appearing with the LOG_MEM_SHM name changed. The section redirecting to this memory region also gets updated accordingly.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<dl class="section note"><dt>Note</dt><dd>The same shared region instances will not appear in the GUI for the selected cores but will get reflected in their linker files.<br  />
Additionally, system projects should not be built at individual core level if there are any shared memory regions. We will see that the individual builds of older projects are breaking with the introduction of this tool. This is due to the fact that some cores do not add some shared memory regions like USER_SHM_MEM, LOG_SHM_MEM from their "respective SYSCFG contexts" (separate syscfg tabs pertaining to these individual cores) yet are still getting them reflected in their tool generated linker.cmd. This is happening because r5fss0-0 is adding these regions and marking them as shared with those other cores. There's a dependency here as we can see, where the only independent core in this case is r5fss0-0 and rest others depend on this. So when you try to build r5fss0-0 individually, it will work BUT rest others when done the same way will fail because they would have those shared memory regions missing in their own linker.cmd as the link between r5fss0-0 and itself is now gone. To summarize, almost all the system projects in our SDK have this dependency (and not only IPC) so they need to be built at system level.</dd></dl>
<p>If we want to test some dependent core individually in a multi-core project, then you need to add those shared regions by opening the syscfg for that core only.</p>
<p>Eg: </p><div class="fragment"><div class="line">make -sC examples/empty/{device_name}/{core_name_os}/{compiler}/ syscfg-gui</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p>And not, </p><div class="fragment"><div class="line">make -sC examples/empty/{device_name}/system_nortos/ syscfg-gui</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p>But the thing to note here is that now when you build system project, there will be conflict coming from the independent core sharing these regions and your current core under test as it will have the same regions added twice (once by the independent and other by itself). Then we will have to remove those from the dependent ones.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md2508"></a>
Impact of Automate MPU Setting</h3>
<p>When the "Automate MPU Setting" option is selected, the tool's behavior is adjusted to align with MPU setting rules. Specifically, memory regions cannot be placed anywhere within a hole; they must be situated at an address that starts at a multiple of their size. The size must be a power of 2 starting from 32 B through 4 GB.</p>
<p>MEM0 and MEM1, both 32B regions of the same type, are arranged as depicted. However, MEM2, which is 128B in size, cannot be positioned immediately after MEM1 due to alignment constraints. Placing it there would result in a start address that is not a multiple of its size. Consequently, the region is relocated to an address where the start aligns with its size, thereby generating a gap between MEM1 and MEM2.</p>
<p> <style>div.image img[src="memory_region_start_address_alignment.png"]{width:90%}</style> </p><div class="image">
<img src="memory_region_start_address_alignment.png" alt=""/>
<div class="caption">
Memory Region Start Address Alignment</div></div>
<p>An MPU setting will be generated with parameters (such as start address and size) mirroring those of its associated memory region. Please note that these parameters will be locked and cannot be altered by the user. Other parameters, such as Access Permissions, Region Attributes, Allow Code Execution, and Sub-Region Disable Mark, can be customized by the user.</p>

<div class="caption">

<p>Within this section, the user has the option to set various parameters for a section.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Section Type Selection: The user can choose from options like LOAD, DSECT, COPY, NOLOAD, and NOINT.</li>
<li>Load Memory and Run Memory Options: These will list all available memory regions added by the user in the previous "Memory Region". By default, the run memory will match the load memory, unless the user chooses to make a specific change.<ul>
<li>Sometimes instead of directing a section into a memory region, we may want to directly specify the memory address. This is possible when we select the option "Address" in "Load to Memory Regions or Address?".</li>
<li>In this case options will appear to enter the value of load and run memory.</li>

<p>Once this option is checked, again in the similar way the user will get options to choose the priority of memory regions.

<ol type="1">
<li>Output Section Requirement: It is mandatory for the user to add at least one output section.</li>

Here, user has to manually delete the conflicting regions.</dd></dl>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md2511"></a>
MPU Settings</h2>
<p>As discussed earlier, let's revisit the functionality of MPU settings with the Automate option.</p>
<p>When the user selects the "Automate MPU Settings" option within the Memory Region, they will have the opportunity to configure the MPU settings specific to that memory region. Note that in this scenario, the start and size parameters are fixed and cannot be altered. This enhancement aims to streamline the configuration process, alleviating the need for separate MPU adjustments.</p>
<p>However, it's worth mentioning that there may be instances where users prefer the flexibility to customize MPU settings. In such cases, they have the option to disable the automation feature.</p>
<dl class="section note"><dt>Note</dt><dd>Even with the automate option enabled, users still retain the ability to add custom MPU configurations with specific addresses or sizes, if necessary. On the other hand, when the automation is disabled, users will be required to manually add all MPU configurations.</dd></dl>
<p>When "Automate MPU Setting" is not selected within the memory region, it results in the loss of the direct one-to-one mapping of the memory region to the MPU configuration view. In such cases, it is beneficial to provide users with a comprehensive overview of how the region is composed.</p>
<p>This should encompass the following information :</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Constituent Regions: Display all the individual regions added within the memory region section that collectively constitute this particular region.</li>
<li>Shared Region Information: Specify if any portion of this region is shared among multiple cores. Additionally, indicate which specific cores have access to this shared region.</li>
<li>Memory Type: Clearly state the type of memory being utilized (e.g., Flash, TCMA, etc.) for this particular region.</li>
</ol>

Enhanced Visualization View</h2>
<p>To facilitate user understanding and ease of navigation, a specialized view has been incorporated.

By-passing Sysconfig generated Linker</h2>
<p>In case user wants to write their own linker file instead of the sysconfig generated one (as earlier versions of SDK), they can achieve that by following some simple steps:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Makefile build<ul>
<li>Go inside the "ti-arm-clang" folder of a core project. For eg: examples/${project_name}/${device}/${core}/ti-arm-clang.<ul>
<li>Create your custom linker file with name "linker.cmd".</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Update the "makefile" inside this current directory.<ul>
<li>Search for "generated/linker.cmd" and replace with just "linker.cmd".</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Build the example. This time the linker you created will be picked during linking phase.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>For CCS build<ul>
<li>Go inside the "ti-arm-clang" folder of a core project. For eg: examples/${project_name}/${device}/${core}/ti-arm-clang.<ul>
<li>Open example.projectspec and add the following towards the end of the file : <br  />
 <code>&lt;file</code> path="linker.cmd" openOnCreation="false" excludeFromBuild="false" action="copy"&gt; <br  />
 <code>&lt;/file&gt;</code> </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Open example.syscfg of this project and remove all the instances added under the Memory Configurator Section.</li>
<li>Build the example. </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
